                        <p>
                                A skybox is a technique that makes the scene looks bigger and more impressive by wrapping the viewer
                                with a texture that goes around the camera 360 degrees. The texture is often a combination between the sky
                                and a terrain type such as mountains, skyscapers, etc. As the player explores his surroundings he keeps seeing
                                a part of the skybox hovering above the real models and filling up all those empty pixels.
                                Here's an example of a skybox from the game Half-Life:
                        </p>
                        <img class="center" src="Halflife_skybox.jpg">
                        <p>
                                The idea behind the skybox is to render a big cube and place the viewer at its center. As the camera
                                moves the cube follows it so that the viewer can never reach the "horizon" of the scene. This is similar to
                                real life where we see the sky "touch" the earth on the horizon but when we move toward the horizon it remains
                                at the same distance from us (pending on land type, etc).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                A special type of texture is mapped on the cube. This
                                texture is created in such a way that if it is cut and folded properly it creates a box where the contents along
                                the edges of the internal faces are perfectly aligned with one another and create a sense of continuity
                                for someone who is located inside the box. For example, see the following texture:
                        </p>
                        <img class="center" src="skybox.jpg">
                        <p>
                                If we cut away the white margins of the texture above and fold the remaining parts along the white lines we will
                                get a box with the required properties. OpenGL calls such a texture a<i> Cubemap</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In order to sample from the cubemap we will use a 3D texture coordinate instead of the 2D coordinate that
                                we have been using thus far. The texture sampler will use this 3D coordinate as a vector and will first find
                                out which of the six faces of the cubemap contains the required texel and then fetch it from within that face.
                                This process can be seen in the following picture which is taken from above (looking down at the box):
                        </p>
                        <img class="center" src="texel_fetch.png">
                        <p>
                                The proper face is selected based on the highest magnitude component of the texture coordinate. In the above
                                example we see that Z has the largest magnitude (Y cannot be seen but let's assume it is smaller than Z).
                                Since Z has a positive sign the texture sampler will use the face entitled 'PosZ' and will fetch the texel
                                from there (the remaining faces are 'NegZ', 'PosX', 'NegX', 'PosY' and 'NegY').
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The skybox technique can actually be implemented using a sphere as well as a box. The only difference is
                                that the length of all possible direction vectors in a sphere is equal (since they represent the radius of
                                the sphere) while in a box there are different lengths. The mechanism for texel fetching remains the same.
                                A skybox which uses a sphere is sometimes called a <i>skydome</i>. This is what we will use for the demo
                                of this tutorial. You should play with both options and see what works best for you.

                                This class wraps the OpenGL implementation of the cubemap texture and provides a simple interface
                                to load and use the cubemap.
                                The constructor takes a directory and six filenames of image files
                                that contain the cubemap faces. For simplicity we assume that all files exist in the same directory.
                                We need to call the function Load() once during startup in order to load the image files and create
                                the OpenGL texture object. The attributes of the class are the image filenames
                                (stored with the full path this time) and the OpenGL texture object handle.     This single handle provides
                                access to all six faces of the cubemap.
                                During runtime Bind() must be called with the proper texture unit in
                                order to make the cubemap available to the shader.

                                The function that loads the cubemap texture starts by generating a texture object. This object is bound
                                to the special GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP target. After that we loop over the 'types' array which contains
                                the GL enums that represent the cubemap faces (GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X,
                                etc). These enums match the attribute string vector 'm_fileNames' which simplifies the loop. The image files
                                are loaded one by one by ImageMagick and then specified to OpenGL using glTexImage2D(). Note that
                                each call to this function is done using the proper GL enum for that face (which is why the 'types' array
                                and 'm_fileNames' must match). After the cubemap is loaded and populated we setup some configuration
                                flags. You should be familiar with all these flags except GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R. This enum simply refers to
                                the third dimension of the texture coordinate. We set it to the same clamping mode as the other dimensions.

                                The skybox is rendered using its own special technique. This technique has only a couple of attributes
                                that the caller must specify - a WVP matrix to transform the box or the sphere and a texture to map
                                on it. Let's see the internals of this class.

                                This is the vertex shader of the skybox technique. It's actually quite simple but you must be
                                aware of a couple of tricks. The first trick is that we transform the incoming position vector
                                using the WVP matrix as always, but in the vector that goes to the fragment shader we override the
                                Z component with the W component. What happens here is that after the vertex shader is complete
                                the rasterizer takes gl_Position vector and performs perspective divide (division by W) in order
                                to complete the projection. When we set Z to W we guarantee that the final Z value of the position
                                will be 1.0. This Z value is always mapped to the far Z. This means that the skybox will always
                                fail the depth test against the other models in the scene. That way the skybox will only take
                                up the background left between the models and everything else will be infront of it, which is
                                exactly what we expect from it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The second trick here is that we use the original position in
                                object space as the 3D texture coordinate. This makes sense because the way sampling from the
                                cubemap works is by shooting a vector from the origin through a point in the box or sphere. So the position
                                of the point actually becomes the texture coordinate. The vertex shader passes the object space coordinate
                                of each vertex as the texture coordinate (8 vertices in the case of a cube and probably much more for
                                a sphere) and it gets interpolated by the rasterizer for each pixel. This gives us the position of
                                the pixel which we can use for sampling.

                                The fragment shader is extremely simple. The only thing worth noting here is that we use a 'samplerCube'
                                rather than a 'sampler2D' in order to access the cubemap.

                                Rendering of the skybox involves several components - a technique, a cubemap texture and a box or sphere model.
                                To simplify its usage this class is suggested as a solution that brings all these components under the
                                same roof. It is initialized once during startup with the directory and filenames of the cubemap texture
                                and then used during runtime by calling Render(). A single function call takes care of everything. Note
                                that in addition to the above components the class also have access to the camera and the perspective projection
                                values (FOV, Z and screen dimensions). This is so that it can populate the Pipeline class properly.

                                This function takes care of rendering the skybox. We start by enabling the skybox technique.
                                Then a new OpenGL API is introduced - glGetIntegerv(). This function returns the state of OpenGL
                                for the enum specified as the first parameter. The second parameter is the address of an array of integers
                                that receives the state (in our case only a single integer is enough). We must use the proper Get* function
                                according to the type of the state - glGetIntegerv(), glGetBooleanv(), glGetInteger64v(), glGetFloatv() and
                                glGetDoublev(). The reason why glGetIntegerv() is used here is because we are going to change a couple of
                                common state values that are usually set in glut_backend.cpp in all of the tutorials. We want to do that in
                                a way which is transparent to the other parts of the code and one solution is to retrieve the current
                                status, make the proper changes and finally restore the original state. That way the rest of the system
                                doesn't need to know that something was changed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The first thing that we change is the culling mode. Usually, we want to cull the triangles that are
                                facing away from the camera. However, in the case of a skybox the camera is placed inside of a box
                                so we want to see their front, rather than their back. The problem is that in the generic
                                sphere model which is used here the external triangles are considered front facing while the internal
                                are backfacing (this is a dependency on the order of the vertices). We can either change the model
                                or reverse the culling state of OpenGL. The later solution is preferable so that the same sphere
                                model can remain generic and usable for other cases. Therefore, we tell OpenGL to cull front facing triangles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The second thing that we change is the depth test function. By default, we tell OpenGL that an incoming
                                fragment wins the depth test if its Z value is less than the stored one. However, in the case of a skybox
                                the Z value is always the far Z (see above). The far Z is clipped  when the depth test function is set
                                to "less than". To make it part of the scene we change the depth function to "less than or equal".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The next thing this function does is to calculate the WVP matrix. Note that the world position of the skybox
                                is set at the camera. This will keep the camera at its center the whole time. After that the cubemap texture
                                is bound to texture unit 0 (this texture unit was also configured in SkyboxTechnique when it was created in
                                SkyBox::Init()). Then the sphere mesh is rendered. Finally, the original cull mode and depth function are
                                restored.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                An interesting performance tip is to always render the skybox last (after all the other models). The reason
                                is that we know that it will always be behind the other objects in the scene. Some GPUs have optimization
                                mechanisms that allow them to do an early depth test and discard a fragment if it fails the test without
                                executing the fragment shader. This is especially helpful in the case of the skybox because then the fragment
                                shader will only run for the pixel encompasing the "background" of the scene and not the ones that are covered
                                by the other models. But to make it happen we must get the depth buffer populated with all the Z values
                                so that by the time the skybox is rendered all the information is already there.
