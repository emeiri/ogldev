                        <p>
                                The spot light is the third and final light type that we will review (at least for a little while...).
                                It is more complex than directional light and point light and essentially borrows stuff from both.
                                The spot light has an origin position and is under the effect of attenuation as distance from target grows (as point light) and its light
                                is pointed at a specific direction (as directional light). The spot light adds the unique attribute of
                                shedding light only within a limited cone that grows wider as light moves further away from its origin.
                                A good example for a spot light is the flashlight. Spot lights are very useful when the character in
                                the game you are developing is exploring an underground dungeon or escaping from prison.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                We already know all the tools to develop the spot light. The missing piece is the cone effect of this light type.
                                Take a look at the following picture:
                        </p>
                        <img class="center" src="spotlight.png">
                        <p>
                                The spot light direction is defined as the black arrow that points straight down. We want our light to have an
                                effect only on the area limited within the two red lines. The dot product operation again comes to the rescue.
                                We can define the cone of light as the angle between each of the red lines and the light direction (i.e. half the angle
                                between the red lines). We can take the cosine 'C' of that angle and perform a dot product between the light direction 'L' and the
                                vector 'V' from the light origin to the pixel. If the result of the dot product is larger than 'C' (remember that a cosine result grows larger
                                as the angle grows smaller), then the angle between 'L' and 'V' is smaller than the angle between 'L' and
                                the two red lines that define the spot light cone. In that case we want the pixel to receive light. If the angle is
                                larger the pixel does not receive any light from the spot light. In the example above a dot product between 'L'
                                and 'V' will yield a result which is smaller than the dot product between 'L' and either one of the red lines (it is
                                quite obvious that the angle between 'L' and 'V' is larger than the angle between 'L' and the red lines).
                                Therefore, the pixel is outside the cone of light and is not illuminated by the spot light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                If we go with this "receive/doesn't receive light" approach we will end up with a highly artificial
                                spot light that has a very noticeable edge between its lit and dark areas. It will look like a perfect
                                circle within total darkness (assuming no other light sources). A more realistic looking spot light is one whose
                                light gradually decreases towards the edges of the circle. We can use the dot product
                                that we calculated (in order to determine whether a pixel is lit or not) as a factor. We already know that
                                the dot product will be 1 (i.e. maximum light) when the vectors 'L' and 'V' are equal. But now we run into
                                some nasty behavior of the cosine function. The spot light angle should not be too large or else the light
                                will be too widespread and we will loose the appearance of a spot light. For example, let's set the angle at 20 degrees.
                                The cosine of 20 degrees is 0.939, but the range [0.939, 1.0] is too small to serve as a factor. There is not
                                enough room there to interpolate values that the eye will be able to notice. The range [0, 1] will provide much better results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The approach that we will use is to map the smaller range defined by the spot light angle into the larger
                                range of [0, 1]. Here's how we do it:
                        </p>
                        <img class="center" src="map.png">
                        <p>
                                The principle is very simple - calculate the ratio between the smaller range and the larger range and scale
                                the specific range you want to map by that ratio.

                                The structure that defines the spot light is derived from PointLight and adds the two attributes that
                                differentiate it from the point light: a direction vector and cutoff value. The cutoff value
                                represents the maximum angle between the light direction and the light to pixel vector for pixels
                                that are under the influence of the spot light. The spot light has no effect beyond the cutoff value.
                                We've also added to the LightingTechnique class an array of locations for the shader (not quoted here).
                                This array allows us to access the spot light array in the shader.

                                There is a similar structure for the spot light type in GLSL. Since we cannot use inheritance here
                                as in the C++ code we use the PointLight structure as a member and add the new attributes next to it.
                                The important difference here is that in the C++ code the cutoff value is the angle itself while in
                                the shader it is the cosine of that angle. The shader only cares about the cosine so it is more
                                efficient to calculate it once and not for every pixel.
                                We also define an array of spot lights and use a counter called 'gNumSpotLights' to allow the
                                application to define the number of spot lights that are actually used.

                                The point light function has gone through a minor modification - it now takes a PointLight structure
                                as a parameter, rather than access the global array directly. This makes it simpler to share
                                it with spot lights. Other than that, there is no change here.

                                This is where we calculate the spot light effect. We start by taking the vector from the light origin
                                to the pixel. As is often the case, we normalize it to get it ready for the dot product ahead. We do a
                                dot product between this vector and the light direction (which has already been normalized by the application)
                                and get the cosine of the angle between them. We then compare it to the light's cutoff value. This is
                                the cosine of the angle between the light direction and the vector that defines its circle of influence.
                                If the cosine is smaller it means the angle between the light direction and the light to pixel vector
                                places the pixel outside the circle of influence. In this case the contribution of this spot light is zero.
                                This will limit the spot light to a small or large circle, depending on the cutoff value.
                                If it is the other way around we calculate the base color as if the light is a point light. Then we take
                                the dot product result that we've just calculated ('SpotFactor') and plug it into the forumla described
                                above. This provides the factor that will linearly interpolate 'SpotFactor' between 0 and 1. We multiply
                                it by the point light color and receive the final spot light color.

                                This function updates the shader program with an array of SpotLight structures. This is the same as
                                the correspoding function for point lights, with two additions. The light direction vector is also applied
                                to the shader, after it has been normalized. Also, the cutoff value is supplied as an angle by the caller but is passed
                                to the shader as the cosine of that angle (allowing the shader to compare a dot product result directly to that value).
                                Note that the library function cosf() takes the angle in radians so we use the handy macro ToRadian in order to translate it.
