                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>In the last few tutorials we have developed several
                        transformations that give us the flexibility of moving an object
                        anywhere in the 3D world. We still have a couple more to learn (camera
                        control and perspective projection) but as you probably already
                        guessed, a combination of the transformation is required. In most cases
                        you will want to scale the object to fit your 3D world, rotate it into
                        the required orientation, move it somewhere, etc. Up till now we have
                        been exercising a single transformation at a time. In order to perform
                        the above series of transformations we need to multiply the first
                        transformation matrix by the vertex position and then multiple the next
                        transformation by the result of the previous multiplication. This goes
                        on until all the transformation matrices have been applied on the
                        vertex. One trivial way to do that is to supply each and every
                        transformation matrix to the shader and let it do all the
                        multiplications. This, however, is very inefficient since the matrices
                        are the same for all vertices and only vertex position changes.
                        Luckily, linear algebra provides a set of rules that make our life
                        easier. It tells us that given a set of matrices M<sub>0</sub>...M<sub>n</sub>
                        and a vector V the following holds true: </p>
                        <p> M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ...  * M<sub>0</sub> * V = (M<sub>n</sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub>) * V </p>
                        <p>So if you calculate:</p>
                        <p>N = M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub></p>
                        <p>Then:</p>
                        <p>M<sub>n </sub>* M<sub>n-1 </sub>* ... * M<sub>0</sub> * V = N * V</p>
                        <p>This means that we can calculate N once and then send it to the shader
                        as a uniform variable where it will be multiplied in each vertex. This
                        will require the GPU one matrix/vector multiplication per vertex.</p>
                        <p>How do you order the matrices when generating N? The first thing you
                        need to remember is that the vector is initially multiplied by the
                        matrix on the far right of the series (in our case - M<sub>0</sub>)<sub>.
                        </sub>Then the vector is transformed by each matrix as we travel from
                        the right hand side to the left hand side. In 3D graphics you usually
                        want to scale the object first, then rotate it, then translate it, then
                        apply camera transformation and finally project it to 2D. Let's see what happens
                        when you rotate first and then translate:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="rot_trans.png">
                        <p>Now see what happens when you translate first and then rotate:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="trans_rot.png">
                        <p>As you can see, it is very diffcult to set the object position in the
                        world when you translate it first because if you move it away from the
                        origin and then rotate it goes around the origin which actually means
                        that you translate it again. This second translation is something you
                        want to avoid. By rotating first and then translate you disconnect the
                        dependency between the two operations. This is why it is always best to
                        model around the origin as symmetrically as possible. That way when you
                        later scale or rotate there is no side effect and the rotated or scaled
                        object remains symmetrical as before.</p>
                        <p>Now that we are starting to handle more than one transformation in the
                        demos we have to drop the habit of updating the matrix directly in the
                        render function. This method doesn't scale well and is prone to errors.
                        Instead, the pipeline class is introduced. This class hides the fine
                        details of matrix manipulation under a simple API to change the
                        translation, rotation, etc. After setting all the parameters inside it
                        you simply extract the final matrix that combines all the
                        transformation. This matrix can be fed directly into the shader.</p>

                        As it happens, the trigonometric functions of the standard C library
                        take radian as a parameter. The above macros take the angle either in
                        radians or degrees and convert to the other notation.</p>

                        <p>This handy operator of the matrix class handles matrix multiplication.
                        As you can see, each entry in the resulting matrix is defined as the
                        dot product of its line in the left matrix with the column in the right
                        matrix. This operator is key in the implementation of the pipeline

                        currently 3 private member vectors that store the scaling, position in
                        world space and rotation for each axis. In addition there are APIs to
                        set them and a function to get the matrix that represent the sum of all
                        these transformations.</p>

                        transformations that match the current configuration. It multiplies
                        them one by one and returns the final product. Note that the order is
                        hard coded and follows the description above. If you need some
                        flexibility there you can use a bitmask that specifies the order. Also
                        note that it always stores the final transformation as a member. You
                        can try optimizing this function by checking a dirty flag and returning
                        the stored martix in the case that there was no change in configuration
                        since the last time this function was called.</p>
                        <p>This function uses private methods to generate the different
                        transformations according to what we've learned in the last few
                        tutorials. In the next tutorials this class will be extended to handle
                        camera control and perspective projection.</p>
                        <code>

                        <p>These are the changes to the render function. We allocate a pipeline
                        object, configure it and send the resulting transformation down to the
                        shader. Play with the parameters and see their effect on the final
                        image.</p>
