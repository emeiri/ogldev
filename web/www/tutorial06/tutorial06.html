                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>In this tutorial we start looking at the various transformations that take an object in 3D and
                        enable it to be displayed on screen while keeping the illusion of depth
                        in the scene. The common way to do this is to represent each
                        transformation using a matrix, multiply them one by one and then
                        multiply the vertex position by the final product. Each tutorial will
                        be dedicated to examining one transformation. </p>
                        <p>Here we take a look at the translation transformation which
                        is responsible to moving an object along a vector of any length and
                        direction. Let's say you want to move the triangle in the left picture
                        to the location on the right:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="translation.png">
                        <p>One way to do it is to provide the offset vector (in this case - 1,1) as a uniform variable to
                        the shader and simply add it to the position of each processed vertex.
                        However, this breaks the method of multiplying a group of matrices into
                        one to get a single comprehensive transformation. In addition, you will
                        see later that translation is usually not the first one so you will have to
                        multiply the position by the matrix that represent the transformations
                        before translation, then add the position and finally multiple by the
                        matrix that represent the transformation that follow translation. This
                        is too awkward. A better way will be to find a matrix that represents
                        the translation and take part in the multiplication of all matrices.
                        But can you find a matrix that when multiplied by the point (0,0), the
                        bottom left vertex of the triangle on the left, gives the result (1,1)?
                        The truth is that you can't do it using a 2D matrix (and you cannot do
                        it with a 3D matrix for (0,0,0) ). In general we can say that what we
                        need is a matrix M that given a point P(x,y,z) and a vector V(v1,v2,v3)
                        provides M * P=P1(x + v1, y + v2, z + v3). In simple words this means
                        that matrix M translates P to location P+V. In P1 we can see that each
                        component is a sum of a component from P and the corresponding
                        component of V. The left side of each sum equation is provided by the
                        identity matrix:<br/>
                        I * P = P(x,y,z). So it looks like we should start with the identity
                        matrix and find out the changes that will complete the right hand side
                        of the sum equation in each component (...+V1, ...+V2, ...+V3). Let's
                        see how the identity matrix looks like:<p>
                        <img class="center" src="equation1.jpg">
                        <p>We want to modify the identity matrix such that the result will be:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="equation2.jpg">
                        <p>There really isn't an easy way to do this if we stick to 3x3 matrix, but
                            if we change to a 4x4 matrix we can do the following:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="equation3.jpg">
                        <p>Representing a 3-vector using a 4-vector like that is called homogenous
                        coordinates and is very popular and useful for 3D graphics. The fourth
                        component is called 'w'. In fact, the internal shader symbol
                        gl_Position that we have seen in the previous tutorial is a 4-vector
                        and the w component has a very important role for making the projection
                        from 3D to 2D. The common notation is to use w=1 for points and w=0 for
                        vectors. The reason is that points can be translated but vectors
                        cannot. You can change the length of a vector or its direction but all
                        vectors with the same length/direction are considered equal, regardless
                        their "starting position". So you can simply use the origin for all
                        vectors. Setting w=0 and multiplying the translation matrix by the
                        vector will result in the same vector.</p>

                        <code>struct Matrix4f {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; float m[4][4];<br/>
                        };</code>
                        <p>We added a 4x4 matrix definition to math_3d.h. This will be used for most of our transformation matrices from now on.</p>
                        <code>GLuint gWorldLocation;</code>
                        <p>We use this handle to access the world matrix uniform variable in the
                        shader. We name it 'world' because what we are doing to the object is
                        moving (translating) its location to where we want it in the coordinate
                        system of our virtual "world".</p>
                        <code>Matrix4f World;<br/>
                        World.m[0][0] = 1.0f; World.m[0][1] = 0.0f; World.m[0][2] = 0.0f; World.m[0][3] = sinf(Scale);<br/>
                        World.m[1][0] = 0.0f; World.m[1][1] = 1.0f; World.m[1][2] = 0.0f; World.m[1][3] = 0.0f;<br/>
                        World.m[2][0] = 0.0f; World.m[2][1] = 0.0f; World.m[2][2] = 1.0f; World.m[2][3] = 0.0f;<br/>
                        World.m[3][0] = 0.0f; World.m[3][1] = 0.0f; World.m[3][2] = 0.0f; World.m[3][3] = 1.0f;</code>
                        <p>In the render function we prepare a 4x4 matrix and poplulate it
                        according to the explanation above. We set v<sub>2</sub> and v<sub>3</sub>
                        to zero so we expect no change in the Y and Z coordinate of the object
                        and we set v<sub>1</sub> to the result of the sinus function. This will
                        translate the X coordinate by a value that swings nicely between -1 and
                        1. Now we need to load the matrix into the shader.</p>
                        <code>glUniformMatrix4fv(gWorldLocation, 1, GL_TRUE, &amp;World.m[0][0]);</code>
                        <p>This is another example of a glUniform* function to load data into
                        uniform shader variables. This specific function loads 4x4 matrices and
                        there are also versions for 2x2, 3x3, 3x2, 2x4, 4x2, 3x4 and 4x3. The
                        first parameter is the location of the uniform variable (retrieved
                        after shader compilation using glGetUniformLocation()). The second
                        parameter indicates the number of matrices we are updating. We use 1
                        for one matrix but we can also use this function to update multiply
                        matrices in one call. The third parameter often confuses newcomers. It
                        indicates whether the matrix is supplied in row-major or column-major
                        order. Row-major means the matrix is supplied row after row, starting
                        from the top. Column-major is the same but in columns. The point is
                        that C/C++ are row-major languages by default. This means that when you
                        populate a two dimentional array with values they are laid out in
                        memory row after row with the "top" row at the lower address. For
                        example, see the following array:</p>
                        <code>int a[2][3];<br>
                        a[0][0] = 1;<br>
                        a[0][1] = 2;<br>
                        a[0][2] = 3;<br>
                        a[1][0] = 4;<br>
                        a[1][1] = 5;<br>
                        a[1][2] = 6;</code>
                        <p>Visually, the array looks like the following matrix:<br>
                        <br>
                        1 2 3<br>
                        4 5 6<br>
                        <br>
                        And the memory layout is like that: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (with 1 at the lower address).</p>
                        <p>So our third parameter to glUniformMatrix4fv() is GL_TRUE because we
                        supply the matrix in row-major order. We can also make the third
                        parameter GL_FALSE but then we will need to transpose the matrix values
                        (the C/C++ memory layout will remain the same but OpenGL will "think"
                        that the first 4 values we supply are actually a matrix column and so
                        on and will behave accordingly). The fourth parameter is simply the
                        starting address of the matrix in memory.</p>
                        <p>The remaining source is shader code.</p>
                        <code>uniform mat4 gWorld;</code>
                        <p>This is a uniform variable of a 4x4 matrix. mat2 and mat3 are also available.</p>
                        <code>gl_Position = gWorld * vec4(Position, 1.0);</code>
                        <p>The position of the triangle vertices in the vertex buffer are vectors
                        of 3 components, but we agreed that we need a fourth component with the
                        value of 1. There are two options: place vertices with 4 components in
                        the vertex buffer or add the fourth component in the vertex shader.
                        There is no advantage to the first option. Each vertex position will
                        consume an additional 4 bytes for a component which is known to be
                        always 1. It is more efficient to stay with a 3 component vector and
                        concatenate the w component in the shader. In GLSL this is done using
                        'vec4(Position, 1.0)'. We multiply the matrix by that vector and the
                        result goes into gl_Position. To summarize, in every frame we generate
                        a translation matrix that translates the X coordinate by a value that
                        goes back and fourth between -1 and 1. The shader multiplies the
                        position of every vertex by that matrix which results in the combined
                        object moving left and right. In most cases the one of the triangles
                        sides will go out of the normalized box after the vertex shader and the
                        clipper will clip out that side. We will only be able to see the region
                        which is inside the normalized box.</p>
