                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>From this tutorial forward every effect and technique we will
                        implement will be done using shaders. Shaders are the modern way of
                        doing 3D graphics. In a way you could claim that this is a step back as
                        most of the 3D functionality that was provided by the fixed function
                        pipeline and required the developer to only specify configuration
                        parameters (lighting attributes, rotation values, etc) must now be
                        implemented by the developer (via shaders), however, this
                        programmability enables great flexibility and innovation.</p>
                        <p>The OpenGL programmable pipeline can be visualized as follows:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="pipeline.png"><br>
                        <p>The vertex processor is in charge of executing the vertex shader on
                        each and every vertex that passes through the pipeline (the number of
                        which is determined according to the parameters to the draw
                        call). Vertex shaders have no knowledge about the topology of the
                        rendered primitives. In addition, you cannot discard vertices in the
                        vertex processor. Each vertex enters the vertex processor exactly once,
                        undergoes transformations and continues down the pipe.</p>
                        <p>The next stage is the geometry processor. In this stage the knoweldge as to the
                        complete primitive (i.e. all of its vertices) as well as neighboring
                        vertices is provided to the shader. This enables techniques that must
                        take into account additional information beside the vertex itself. The
                        geometry shader also has the ability to switch the output topology to a
                        different one than the topology selected in the draw call. For example,
                        you may supply it with a list of points and genereate two triangles
                        (i.e. a quad) from each point (a technique known as billboarding). In
                        addition, you have the option to emit multiple vertices for each
                        geometry shader invocation and thus generate multiple primitives
                        according to the output topology you selected.</p>
                        <p>The next stage in the pipe is the clipper. This is a fixed function
                        unit with a straightforward task - it clips the primitives to the
                        normalized box we have seen in the previous tutorial. It also clips
                        them to the near Z and the far Z planes. There is also the option to
                        supply user clip planes and have the clipper clip against them. The
                        position of vertices that have survived the clipper is now mapped to
                        screen space coordinates and the rasterizer renders them to the screen
                        according to their topology. For example, in the case of triangles this
                        means finding out all the points that are inside the triangle. For each
                        point the rasterizer invokes the fragment processor. Here you have the
                        option to determine the color of the pixel by sampling it from a
                        texture or using whatever technique you desire. </p>
                        <p>The three programmable stages (vertex, geometry and fragment
                        processors) are optional. If you don't bind a shader to them some
                        default functionality will be executed. </p>
                        <p>Shader management is very similar to C/C++ program creation. First you
                        write the shader text and make it available to your program. This can
                        done by simply including the text in an array of characters in the
                        source code itself or by loading it from an external text file (again
                        into an array of characters). Then you compile the shaders one by one
                        into shader objects. After that you link the shaders into a single
                        program and load it into the GPU. Linking the shaders gives the driver
                        the opportunity to trim down the shaders and optimize them according to
                        their relationships. For example, you may pair a vertex shader that
                        emits a normal with a fragment shader that ignores it. In that case the
                        GLSL compiler in the driver can remove the normal related functionality
                        of the shader and enable faster execution of the vertex shader. If that
                        shader is later paired with a fragment shader that uses the normal then
                        linking the other program will generate a different vertex shader. </p>

                <section>
                        <h3> Source walkthru </h3>

                        <code>GLuint ShaderProgram = glCreateProgram();</code>
                        <p>We start the process of setting up our shaders by creating a program
                        object. We will link all the shaders together into this object.</p>
                        <code>GLuint ShaderObj = glCreateShader(ShaderType);</code>
                        <p>We create two shader objects using the above call. One of them with
                        shader type GL_VERTEX_SHADER and the other GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER. The
                        process of specifying the shader source and compiling the shader is the
                        same for both.</p>
                        <code>const GLchar* p[1];<br/>
                        p[0] = pShaderText;<br/>
                        GLint Lengths[1];<br/>
                        Lengths[0]= strlen(pShaderText);<br/>
                        glShaderSource(ShaderObj, 1, p, Lengths);<br/>
                        </code>
                        <p>Before compiling the shader object we must specify its source code. The
                        function glShaderSource takes the shader object as a parameter and
                        provides you with flexibility in terms of specifying the source. The
                        source can be distributed across several character arrays and you will
                        need to provide an array of pointers to these arrays as well as an
                        array of integers where each slot contains the length of the
                        corresponding character array. For simplicity we use a single array of
                        chars for the entire shader source and we use just one slot for both
                        the pointer to the source as well as its length. The second parameter
                        to the call is the number of slots in the two arrays (just 1 in our
                        case).</p>
                        <code>glCompileShader(ShaderObj);</code>
                        <p>Compiling the shader is very easy...</p>
                        <code>GLint success;<br/>
                        glGetShaderiv(ShaderObj, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;success);<br/>
                        if (!success) {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GLchar InfoLog[1024];<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glGetShaderInfoLog(ShaderObj, sizeof(InfoLog), NULL, InfoLog);<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fprintf(stderr, "Error compiling shader type %d: '%s'\n", ShaderType, InfoLog);<br/>
                        }</code>
                        <p>...however, you usually get a few compilation errors, as expected. The
                        piece of code above gets the compilation status and display all the
                        errors the compiler encountered.</p>
                        <code>glAttachShader(ShaderProgram, ShaderObj);</code>
                        <p>Finally, we attach the compiled shader object to the program object.
                        This is very similar to specifying the list of objects for linking in a
                        makefile. Since we don't have a makefile here we emulate this behavior
                        programatically. Only the attached objects take part of the linking
                        process.</p>
                        <code>glLinkProgram(ShaderProgram);</code>
                        <p>After compiling all shader objects and attaching them to the program we
                        can finally link it. Note that after linking the program you can get
                        rid of the intermediate shader objects by calling glDetachShader and glDeleteShader for
                        each and every one of them. The OpenGL driver maintains a reference count
                        on most of the objects it generates. If a shader object is created and then deleted
                        the driver will get rid of it, but if it is attached to a program calling glDeleteShader
                        will only mark it for deletion and you will also need to call glDetachShader so
                        that its reference count will drop to zero and it will be removed. </p>
                        <code>glGetProgramiv(ShaderProgram, GL_LINK_STATUS, &amp;Success);<br/>
                        if (Success == 0) {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glGetProgramInfoLog(ShaderProgram, sizeof(ErrorLog), NULL, ErrorLog);<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fprintf(stderr, "Error linking shader program: '%s'\n", ErrorLog);<br/>
                        }</code>
                        <p>Note that we check for program related errors (such as link errors) a
                        bit differently than shader related errors. Instead of glGetShaderiv we
                        use glGetProgramiv and instead of glGetShaderInfoLog we use
                        glGetProgramInfoLog. </p>
                        <code>glValidateProgram(ShaderProgram);</code>
                        <p>You may ask yourself why do we need to validate a program after it has
                        been successfully linked. The difference is that linking checks for
                        errors based on the combination of shaders while the call above check
                        whether the program can execute given the current pipeline state. In a
                        complex application with multiple shaders and lots of state changes it
                        is better to validate before every draw call. In our simple app we
                        check it just once. Also, you may want to do this check only during
                        development and avoid this overhead in the final product. </p>
                        <code>glUseProgram(ShaderProgram);</code>
                        <p>Finally, to use the linked shader program you set it into the pipeline
                        state using the call above. This program will stay in effect for all
                        draw calls until you replace it with another or explicitly disable its
                        use (and enable the fixed function pipeline) by calling glUseProgram
                        with NULL. If you created a shader program that contains only one type
                        of shader then the other stages operate using their default fixed
                        functionality.</p>
                        <p>We have completed the walkthru of the OpenGL calls related to shader
                        management. The rest of this tutorial relates to the contents of the
                        vertex and fragment shaders (contained in the 'pVS' and 'pFS' variables).</p>
                        <code>#version 330</code>
                        <p>This tells the compiler that we are targeting version 3.3 of GLSL. If
                        the compiler does not support it it will emit an error. </p>
                        <code>layout (location = 0) in vec3 Position;</code>
                        <p>This statement appears in the vertex shader. It declares that a vertex
                        specific attribute which is a vector of 3 floats will be known as
                        'Position' in the shader. 'Vertex specific' means that for every
                        invocation of the shader in the GPU the value of a new vertex from the
                        buffer will be supplied. The first section of the statement, layout
                        (location = 0), creates the binding between the attribute name and
                        attribute in the buffer. This is required for cases where our vertex
                        contains several attributes (position, normal, texture coordinates,
                        etc). We have to let the compiler know which attribute in the vertex in
                        the buffer must be mapped to the declared attribute in the shader.
                        There are two ways to do this. We can either set it explicitly as we do
                        here (to zero). In that case we can use a hard coded value in our
                        application (which we did with the first parameter to the call to
                        glVertexAttributePointer). Or we can leave it out (and simply declare
                        'in vec3 Position' in the shader) and then query the location from the
                        application at runtime using glGetAttribLocation. In that case we will
                        need to supply the returned value to glVertexAttributePointer instead
                        of using the hard coded value. We choose the simply way here but for
                        more complex applications it better to let the compiler determine the
                        attribute indices and query them during runtime. This makes it easier
                        integrating shaders from multiple sources without adapting them to your
                        buffer layout.</p>
                        <code>void main()</code>
                        <p>You can create your shader by linking together multiple shader objects.
                        However, there can only be one main function for each shader stage (VS,
                        GS, FS) which is used as the entry point to the shader. For example,
                        you can create a lighting library with several functions and link it
                        with your shader provided that none of the functions there is named
                        'main'. </p>
                        <code>gl_Position = vec4(0.5 * Position.x, 0.5 * Position.y, Position.z, 1.0);</code>
                        <p>Here we do hard coded transformation to the incoming vertex position.
                        We cut the X and Y values by half and leave the Z unchanged.
                        'gl_Position' is a special built in variable that is supposed to
                        contain the homogeneous (containing X, Y, Z and W components) vertex
                        position. The rasterizer will look for that variable and will use it as
                        the position in screen space (following a few more transformations).
                        Cutting the X and Y values by half means that we will see a triangle
                        which is one quarter the size of the triangle in the previous tutorial.
                        Note that we are setting W to 1.0. This is extremely important to getting
                        the triangle displayed correctly. Getting the projection from 3D to 2D
                        is actually accomplished in two seperate stages. First you need to
                        multiply all your vertices by the projection matrix (which we will
                        develop in a few tutorials) and then the GPU automatically performs
                        what is known as "perspective divide" to the position attribute before
                        it reaches the rasterizer. This means that it divides all the
                        components of the gl_Position by the W component. In this tutorial we
                        are not yet doing any projection in the vertex shader but the
                        perspective divide stage is something that we cannot disable. Whatever
                        gl_Position value we output from the vertex shader will be divided by
                        the HW using its W component. We need to remember that else we will not
                        get the results we expect. In order to circumvent the effect of
                        perspective divide we set W to 1.0. Division by 1.0 will not affect the
                        other components of the position vector which will stay inside our
                        normalized box.</p>
                        <p>If everything worked correctly, three vertices with the values (-0.5,
                        -0.5), (0.5, -0.5) and (0.0, 0.5) reach the rasterizer. The clipper
                        doesn't need to do anything because all vertices are well inside the
                        normalized box. These values are mapped to screen space coordinates and
                        the rasterizer starts running over all the points that are inside the
                        triangle. For each point the fragment shader is executed. The following
                        shader code is taken from the fragment shader.</p>
                        <code>out vec4 FragColor;</code>
                        <p>Usually the job of the fragment shader is to determine the color of the
                        fragment (pixel). In addition, the fragment shader can discard the
                        pixel altogether or change its Z value (which will affect the result of
                        subsequent Z test). Outputing the color is done by declaring the above
                        variable. The four components represent R, G, B and A (for alpha). The
                        value that you set into this variable will be received by the
                        rasterizer and evantually written to the framebuffer.</p>
                        <code>FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);</code>
                        <p>In the previous couple of tutorials there wasn't a fragment shader so
                        the everything was drawn in the default color of white. Here we set
                        FragColor to red.</p>
