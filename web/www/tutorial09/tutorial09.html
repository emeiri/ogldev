                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>This tutorial demonstrates
                        a very important part of the 3D pipeline - the interpolation that the
                        rasterizer performs on variables that come out of the vertex shader. As
                        you have already seen, in order to get something meaningful on the
                        screen you need to designate one of the VS output variables as
                        'gl_Position'. This is a 4-vector that contains the homogenuous
                        coordinates of the vertex. The XYZ components of that vector are
                        divided by the W component (a process known as perspective divide and
                        is dealt with in the tutorial dedicated to that subject) and any
                        component which goes outside the normalized box ([-1,1]) gets clipped.
                        The result is transformed to screen space
                        coordinates and then the triangle (or any other supported primitive
                        type) is rendered to screen by the rasterizer.</p>
                        <p>The rasterizer performs
                        interpolation between the three triangle vertices (either going line by
                        line or any other technique) and "visits" each pixel inside the
                        triangle by executing the fragment shader. The fragment shader is
                        expected to return a pixel color which the rasterizer places in the
                        color buffer for display (after passing a few additional tests like
                        depth test, etc). Any other variable which comes out of the vertex
                        shader does not go through the steps above. If the fragment shader does
                        not explicitly requests that variable (and you can mix and match
                        multiple fragment shaders with the same vertex shader) then a common
                        driver optimization will be to drop any instructions in the VS that
                        only affect this variable (for that particular shader program that
                        combines this VS and FS pair). However, if the FS does use that
                        variable the rasterizer interpolates it during rasterization and each
                        FS invocation is provided a the interpolated value that matches that
                        specific location. This usually means that the values for pixels that
                        are right next to each other will be a bit different (though as the
                        triangle becomes further and further away from the camera that becomes
                        less likely). </p>
                        <p>Two very common variables that often rely on this
                        interpolation are the triangle normal and texture coordinates. The
                        vertex normal is usually calculated as the average between the triangle
                        normals of all triangles that include that vertex. If that object is
                        not completely flat this usually means that the three vertex normals of
                        each triangle will be different from each other. In that case we rely
                        on interpolation to calculate the specific normal at each pixel. That
                        normal is used in lighting calculations in order to generate a more
                        believable representation of lighting effects. The case for texture
                        coordinates is similar. These coordinates are part of the model and are
                        specified per vertex. In order to "cover" the triangle with a texture
                        you need to perform the sample operation for each pixel and specify the
                        correct texture coordinates for that pixel. These coordinates are the
                        result of the interpolation.</p>
                        <p>In this tutorial we will see the effects of interpolation by
                        interpolating different colors across the triangle face. Since I'm lazy
                        we will generate the color in the VS. A more tedious approach is to
                        supply it from the vertex buffer. Usually you don't supply colors from
                        the vertex buffer. You supply texture coordinates and sample a color
                        from a texture. That color is later processed by the lighting
                        calculations.</p>

                        <code>out vec4 Color;</code>
                        <p>Parameters passed between pipeline stages must be declared using the
                        'out' reserved word and in the global scope of the shader. The color is
                        a 4-vector since the XYZ components carry the RGB values (respectively)
                        and W is the alpha value (pixel transparency).</p>
                        <code>Color = vec4(clamp(Position, 0.0, 1.0), 1.0);</code>
                        <p>Color in the graphics pipeline is usually represented using a floating
                        point value in the range [0.0, 1.0]. That value is later mapped to the
                        integer 0 to 255 for each color channel (totaling in 16M colors). We
                        set the vertex color value as a function of the vertex position. First
                        we use the built-in function clamp() to make sure the values do not go
                        outside of the 0.0-1.0 range. The reason is that the lower left vertex
                        of the triangle is located at -1,-1. If we take that value as-is it
                        will be interpolated by the rasterizer and until both X and Y pass zero
                        we will not see anything because every value which is less than or
                        equal to zero will be rendered as black. This means that half of the
                        edge on each direction will be black before the color pass zero and
                        become something meaningful. By clamping we make only the far bottom
                        left black but as we get further away the color quickly becomes more
                        bright. Try playing with the clamp function - remove it all together or
                        change its parameters to see the effect. </p>
                        <p>The result of the clamp function does not go directly to the output
                        variable since it is a 4-vector while the position is a 3-vector (clamp
                        does not change the number of components, only their values). From the
                        point of view of GLSL there is no default conversion here and we have
                        to make this explicit. We do this using the notation 'vec4(vec3, W)'
                        which creates a 4-vector by concatenating a 3-vector with the supplied
                        W value. In our case we use 1.0 because this goes into the alpha part
                        of the color and we want the pixel to be completely opaque.</p>
                        <code>in vec4 Color;</code>
                        <p>The opposite side of the output color in the VS is the input color in
                        the FS. This variable undergoes interpolation by the rasterizer so
                        every FS is (probably) executed with a different color. </p>
                        <code>FragColor = Color;</code>
                        <p>We use the interpolated color as the fragment color with no further
                        changes and this completes this tutorial.</p>
