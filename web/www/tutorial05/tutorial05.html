                <h3> Background </h3>

                <p>In this tutorial we meet a new type of shader variables -
                    uniform variables. The difference between attribute and uniform
                    variable is that attribute variables contain data which is vertex
                    specific so they are reloaded with a new value from the vertex buffer
                    for each shader invocation while the value of uniform variables remains
                    constant accross the entire draw call. This means that you load the
                    value before making the draw call and then you can access the same
                    value in each invocation of the vertex shader. Uniform variables are
                    useful for storing data such as lighting parameters (light position and
                    direction, etc), transformation matrices, texture objects handles and
                    so on. </p>
                <p> In this tutorial we finally get something moving on the screen. We do
                    it using a combination of a uniform variable whose value we change
                    every frame and the idle callback function supplied by GLUT. The point
                    is that GLUT doesn't call our render callback function repeatedly -
                    unless it has to. GLUT has to call the render callback following events
                    such as minimizing and maximizing the window or uncovering it by
                    another window. If we don't change anything in the windows layout after
                    launching the application the render callback is called just once. You
                    can see for yourself by adding a printf call in the render function.
                    You will see the output only once and you will see it again if you
                    minimize and then maximize the window. Registering only the render
                    callback in GLUT was fine for the previous tutorials but here we want
                    to repeatedly change the value of a variable. We do this by registering
                    an idle function callback. The idle function is called by GLUT when no
                    events are received from the windowing system. You can have a dedicated
                    function for this callback where you will do any bookkeeping such as
                    time update or simply register the render callback function as an idle
                    callback as well. In this tutorial we do the later and update the
                    variable inside the render function.</p>

                <code>glutIdleFunc(RenderSceneCB);</code>
                <p>Here we register the render callback as an idle function. Note that if
                    you decide to use a dedicated idle callback function then you will need
                    to add a call to glutPostRedisplay() at the end of it. Else the idle
                    function will be called again and again but the render function will
                    not. glutPostRedisplay() marks the current window as needed to be
                    redisplayed and during the next round through GLUT's main loop the
                    render callback will be called.</p>
                <code>gScaleLocation = glGetUniformLocation(ShaderProgram, "gScale");<br/>
                        assert(gScaleLocation != 0xFFFFFFFF);</code>
                <p>After linking the program we query the program object for the location
                    of the uniform variable. This is another example of a case where the
                    application C/C++ execution environment needs to be mapped to the
                    shader execution environment. You don't have any direct access to
                    shader content and you cannot directly update its variables. When you
                    compile the shader the GLSL compiler assigns an index to each uniform
                    variable. In the internal representation of the shader inside the
                    compiler access to the variable is resolved using its index. That index
                    is also available to the application via the glGetUniformLocation. You
                    call this function with the program object handle and the name of the
                    variable. The function returns the index or -1 if there was an error.
                    It is very important to check for errors (as we do above with the
                    assertion) or else future updates to the variables will not be
                    delivered to the shader. There are mainly two reasons why this function
                    can fail. You either misspelled the name of the variable or it was
                    optimized away by the compiler. If the GLSL compiler finds out that the
                    variable is not actually used in the shader it can simply drop it. In
                    that case glGetUniformLocation will fail. </p>
                <code>static float Scale = 0.0f;<br/>
                        Scale += 0.001f;<br/>
                        glUniform1f(gScaleLocation, sinf(Scale));</code>
                <p>We maintain a static floating point variable that we increment a bit in
                    every call to the render function (you may want to play with 0.001 if
                    it runs too slowly or too quickly on your machine). The actual value
                    which is passed to the shader is the sinus of the 'Scale' variable.
                    This is to create a nice loop between -1.0 and 1.0. Note that sinf()
                    takes radians and not degrees as a parameter but at this point we
                    simply don't care. We just want the wave that sinus generates. The
                    result of sinf() is passed to the shader using glUniform1f. OpenGL
                    provides multiple instances of this function with the general form of
                    glUniform{1234}{if}. You can use it to load values into a 1D, 2D, 3D or
                    4D (based on the number that follows the 'glUniform') vector of
                    floating point or integer (this is the 'i' or 'f' suffix). There are
                    also versions that take a vector address as a parameter as well as
                    special version for matrices. The first parameter to the function is
                    the index location that we have extracted using glGetUniformLocation().</p>
                <p>We will now take a look at changes that were made in the VS (the FS remains unchanged).</p>
                <code>uniform float gScale;</code>
                <p>Here we declare the uniform value in the shader.</p>
                <code>gl_Position = vec4(gScale * Position.x, gScale * Position.y, Position.z, 1.0);</code>
                <p>We multiply the X and Y values of the position vector with the value
                    that is changed from the application every frame. Can you explain why
                    the triangle is upside down half of the loop?</p>
