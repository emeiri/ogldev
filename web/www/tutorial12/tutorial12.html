                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>We have finally reached the
                        item that represents 3D graphics best - the projection from the 3D
                        world on a 2D plane while maintaining the appearance of depth. A good
                        example is a picture of a road or railway-tracks that seem to converge
                        down to a single point far away in the horizon. </p>
                        <p>We are going to generate the transformation that satisfies
                        the above requirement and we have an additional requirement we want to
                        "piggyback" on it which is to make life easier for the clipper by
                        representing the projected coordinates in a normalized space of -1 to
                        +1. This means the clipper can do its work without having knowledge of
                        the screen dimension and the location of the near and far planes.</p>
                        <p>The perspective projection tranformation will require us to supply 4 parameters:</p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The aspect ratio - the ratio between the width and the height of the rectangular area which will be the target of projection.<br> </li>
                          <li>The vertical field of view: the vertical angle of the camera through which we are looking at the world.</li>
                          <li>The location of the near Z plane. This allows us to clip objects that are too close to the camera.</li>
                          <li>The location of the far Z plane. This allows us to clip objects that are too distant from the camera.</li>
                        </ol></p>
                        <p>The aspect ratio is required since we are going to represent all coordinates in a
                        normalized space whose width is equal to its height. Since this is
                        rarely the case with the screen where the width is usually larger than
                        the height it will need to be represented in the transformation by
                        somehow "condensing" the points on the horizontal line vs. the vertical
                        line. This will enable us to squeeze in more coordinates in terms of
                        the X component in the normalized space which will satisfy the
                        requirement of "seeing" more on the width than on the height in the
                        final image. </p>
                        <p>The vertical field of view allows us to zoom in and out on
                        the world. Consider the following example. In the picture on the left
                        hand side the angle is wider which makes objects smaller while in the
                        picture on the right hand side the angle is smaller which makes the
                        same object appear larger. Note that this has an effect on the location
                        of the camera which is a bit counter intuitive. On the left (where we
                        zoom in with a smaller field of view) the camera needs to be placed
                        further away and on the right it is closer to the projection plane.
                        However, remember that this has no real effect since the projected
                        coordinates are mapped to the screen and the location of the camera
                        plays no part. </p>
                        <img class="center" src="FOV.png">
                        <p>We start by determining the distance of the projection plane from the
                        camera. The projection plane is a plane which is parallel to the XY
                        plane. Obviously, not the entire plane is visible because this is too
                        much. We can only see stuff in a rectangular area (called the projection window) which has the same
                        proportions of our screen. The apsect ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
                        <p>ar = screen width / screen height</p>
                        <p>Let us conviniently determine the height of the projection window as 2
                        which means the width is exactly twice the aspect ratio (see the above
                        equation). If we place the camera in the origin and look at the area
                        from behind the camera's back we will see the following:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="projection_window.png">
                        <p>Anything outside this rectangle is going to be clipped away and we
                        already see that coordinates inside it will have their Y component in
                        the required range. The X component is currently a bit bigger but we
                        will provide a fix later on.</p>
                        <p>Now let's take a look at this "from the side" (looking down at the YZ
                        plane):</p>
                        <img class="center" src="side_view1.png">
                        <p>We find the distance from the camera to the projection plane using the
                        vertical field of view (denoted by the angle alpha):</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_01.png">
                        <p>The next step is to calculate the projected coordinates of X and Y.
                        Consider the next image (again looking down at the YZ plane).</p>
                        <img class="center" src="side_view2.png">
                        <p>We have a point in the 3D world with the coordinates (x,y,z). We want to find (x<sub>p</sub>,y<sub>p</sub>)
                        that represent the projected coordinates on the projection plane. Since
                        the X component is out of scope in this diagram (it is pointing in and
                        out of the page) we'll start with Y. According to the rule of similar
                        triangles we can determine the following:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_02.png">
                        <p>In the same manner for the X component:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_03.png">
                        <p>Since our projection window is 2*ar (width) by 2 (height) in size we
                        know that a point in the 3D world is inside the window if it is
                        projected to a point whose projected X component is between -ar and +ar
                        and the projected Y component is between -1 and +1. So on the Y
                        component we are normalized but on the X component we are not. We can
                        get Xp normalized as well by further dividing it by the aspect ratio.
                        This means that a point whose projected X component was +ar is now +1
                        which places it on the right hand side of the normalized box. If its
                        projected X component was +0.5 and the aspect ratio was 1.333 (which is
                        what we get on an 1024x768 screen) the new projected X component
                        is 0.375. To summarize, the division by the aspect ratio has the effect
                        of condensing the points on the X axis. </p>
                        <p>We have reached the following projection equations for the X and Y components:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_04.png">
                        <p>Before completing the full process let's try to see how the projection
                        matrix would look like at this point. This means representing the above
                        using a matrix. Now we run into a problem. In both equations we need to
                        divide X and Y by Z which is part of the vector that represents
                        position. However, the value of Z changes from one vertex to the next
                        so you cannot place it into one matrix that projects all vertices. To
                        understand this better think about the top row vector of the matrix (a, b, c, d). We need to select the values of the
                        vector such that the following will hold true:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_05.png">
                        <p>This is the dot product operation between the top
                        row vector of the matrix with the vertex position which yields the
                        final X component. We can select 'b' and 'd' to be zero but we cannot
                        find an 'a' and 'c' that can be plugged into the left hand side and provide the results on the right
                        hand side. The solution adopted by OpenGL is to seperate
                        the transformation into two parts: a multiplication by a projection
                        matrix followed by a division by the Z value as an independant step. The matrix is provided by the
                        application and the shader must include the multiplication of the position by it. The division by
                        the Z is hard wired into the GPU and takes place in the rasterizer (somewhere between the vertex
                        shader and the fragment shader). How does the GPU knows which vertex shader output to divide by
                        its Z value? simple - the built-in variable gl_Position is designated for that job.
                        Now we only need to find a matrix that represents the projection
                        equations of X &amp; Y above. </p>
                        <p>After multiplying by that matrix the GPU can divide by Z automatically for us and we get the
                        result we want. But here's another complexity: if we multiply the
                        matrix by the vertex position and then divide it by Z we literally
                        loose the Z value because it becomes 1 for all vertices. The original Z value
                        must be saved in order to perform the depth test later on. So the trick
                        is to copy the original Z value into the W component of the resulting
                        vector and divide only XYZ by W instead of Z. W maintains the original Z which
                        can be used for depth test. The automatic step of dividing gl_Position by its W is called 'perspective divide'.
                        </p>
                        <p>We can now generate an intermediate matrix that represents the above
                        two equations as well as the copying of the Z into the W component:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_06.png">
                        <p>As I said earlier, we want to include the normalization of the Z value
                        as well to make it easier for the clipper to work without knowing the
                        near and far Z values. However, the matrix above turns Z into zero.
                        Knowing that after transforming the vector the system will
                        automatically do perspective divide we need to select the values of the
                        third row of the matrix such that following the division any Z value
                        within viewing range (i.e. NearZ &lt;= Z &lt;= FarZ) will be mapped
                        to the [-1,1] range. Such a mapping operation is composed of two
                        parts. First we scale down the range [NearZ, FarZ] down to any range with a width of 2. Then we move (or translate)
                        the range such that it will start at -1. Scaling the Z value and then
                        translating it is represented by the general function:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_07.png">
                        <p>But following perspective divide the right hand side of the function becomes:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_08.png">
                        <p>Now we need to find the values of A and B that will perform the maping to [-1,1]. We know that when
                        Z equals NearZ the result must be -1 and that when Z equals FarZ the result must be 1. Therefore we can write:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_09.png">
                        <p>Now we need to select the third row of the matrix as the vector (a b c d) that will satisfy:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_10.png">
                        <p>We can immediately set 'a' and 'b' to be zero because we don't
                        want X and Y to have any effect on the transformation of Z. Then our A
                        value can become 'c' and the B value can become 'd' (since W is known
                        to be 1). </p>
                        <p>Therefore, the final transformation matrix is:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="12_11.png">
                        <p>After multiplying the vertex position by the projection matrix the coordinates are said to be
                        in <i>Clip Space</i> and after performing the perspective divide the coordinates are in <i>NDC Space</i> (<span
                         style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span>ormalized <span
                         style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>evice <span
                         style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>oordinates). </p>
                        <p>The path that we have taken in this series of tutorials should now become clear.
                        Without doing any projection we can simply
                        output vertices from the VS whose XYZ components (of the position vector) are within the
                        range of [-1,+1]. This will make sure they end up somewhere in the screen.
                        By making sure that W is always 1 we basically prevent perspective divide from having any effect.
                        After that the coordinates are transformed to screen space and we are done. When using the
                        projection matrix the perspective divide step becomes an integral part
                        of the 3D to 2D projection.</p>

                        <p>A structure called m_persProj was added to the Pipeline class
                        that holds the perspective projection configurations. The method above
                        generates the matrix that we have developed in the background section.</p>
                        <code>m_transformation = PersProjTrans * TranslationTrans * RotateTrans * ScaleTrans;</code>
                        <p>We add the perspective projection matrix as the first element in the
                        multiplication that generates the complete transformation. Remember
                        that since the position vector is multiplied on the right hand side
                        that matrix is actually the last. First we scale, then rotate,
                        translate and finally project.</p>
                        <code>p.SetPerspectiveProj(30.0f, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, 1.0f, 1000.0f);</code>
                        <p>In the render function we set the projection parameters. Play with
                        these and see their effect.</p>
