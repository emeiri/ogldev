                        <h3> Background </h3>

                        <p>OpenGL provides several draw functions. glDrawArrays() that we have been using until now falls
                        under the category of "ordered draws". This means that the vertex buffer is scanned from
                        the specified offset and every X (1 for points, 2 for lines, etc)
                        vertices a primitive is emitted. This is very simple to use but the
                        downside is if a vertex is part of several primitives then it must be
                        present several times in the vertex buffer. That is, there is no
                        concept of sharing. Sharing is provided by the draw functions that
                        belong to the "indexed draws" category. Here in addition to the vertex
                        buffer there is also an index buffer that contains indices into the
                        vertex buffer. Scanning the index buffer is similar to scanning the
                        vertex buffer - every X indices a primitive is emitted. To exercise
                        sharing you simply repeat the index of the shared vertex several times.
                        Sharing is very important for memory efficiency because most objects
                        are represented by some closed mesh of triangles and most vertices
                        participate in more than one triangle.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of an ordered draw:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="ordered_draw.png">
                        <p>If we are rendering triangles the GPU will generate the following set:
                        V0/1/2, V3/4/5, V6/7/8, etc.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of an indexed draw:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="indexed_draw.png">
                        <p>In this case the GPU will generate the following triangles: V2/0/1,
                        V5/2/4, V6/5/7, etc.</p>
                        <p>Using index draws in OpenGL requires generating and populating an index
                        buffer. That buffer must be bound in addition to the vertex buffer
                        before the draw call and a different API must be used.</p>

                        <code>GLuint IBO;</code>
                        <p>We added another buffer object handle for the index buffer.</p>
                        <code>
                        Vertices[0] = Vector3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);<br>
                        Vertices[1] = Vector3f(0.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f);<br>
                        Vertices[2] = Vector3f(1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);<br>
                        Vertices[3] = Vector3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);</code>
                        <p>To demonstrate vertex sharing we need a mesh which is a bit more
                        complex. Many tutorials use the famous spinning cube for that. This
                        requires 8 vertices and 12 triangles. Since I'm lazy I use the spinning
                        pyramid instead. This requires only 4 vertices and 4 triangles and is
                        much easier to generate manually...</p>
                        <p>When looking at these vertices from the top (along the Y axis) we get
                        the following layout:</p>
                        <img class="center" src="pyramid.png"><br>
                        <code>unsigned int Indices[] = { 0, 3, 1,<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        1, 3, 2,<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        2, 3, 0,<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        0, 1, 2 };</code>
                        <p>The index buffer is populated using an array of indices. The indices
                        match the location of the vertices in the vertex buffer. When looking
                        at the array and the diagram above you can see that the last triangle
                        is the pyramid base while the other three make up its faces. The
                        pyramid is not symmetric but is very easy to specify.</p>
                        <code>
                        glGenBuffers(1, &amp;IBO);<br>
                        glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, IBO);<br>
                        glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(Indices), Indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
                        </code>
                        <p>We create and then populate the index buffer using the array of
                        indices. You can see that the only difference in creating vertex and
                        index buffers is that vertex buffers take GL_ARRAY_BUFFER as the buffer
                        type while index buffers take GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. </p>
                        <code>glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, IBO);</code>
                        <p>In addition to binding the vertex buffer we must also bind the index
                        buffer prior to drawing. Again, we use the GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER as the buffer type.</p>
                        <code>glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 12, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);</code>
                        <p>
                        We use glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays. The first parameter is
                        the primitive type to render (same as glDrawArrays). The second
                        parameter is the number of indices in the index buffer to use for
                        primitive generation. The next parameter is the type of each index. The
                        GPU must be told the size of each individual index else it will not
                        know how to parse the buffer. Possible values here are
                        GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, GL_UNSIGNED_INT. If the index
                        range is small you want the smaller types that are more space efficient
                        and if the index range is large you want the larger types. The final
                        parameter tells the GPU the offset in bytes from the start of the index
                        buffer to the location of the first index to scan. This is useful when
                        the same index buffer contains the indices of multiple objects. By
                        specifying the offset and count you can tell the GPU which object to
                        render. In our case we want to start at the beginning so we specify
                        zero. Note that the type of the last parameter is GLvoid* so if you
                            specify anything other than zero you need to cast it to that type. </p>

                        <p>Oct-23, 2021 - by voytechj on youtube: the OpenGL pipeline includes a post transform
                            cache that stores the results of the vertex shader. If the same vertex passes through
                            the pipeline again (a case identified by the reuse of the index) the processing of the
                            vertex shader can be skipped by fetching the cache results. Therefore, the advantage
                            of indexed draws is not only in memory saving but in performance as well. More info in the <href a="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Post_Transform_Cache">OpenGL wiki</href>
