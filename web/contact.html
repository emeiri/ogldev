<big><big>My name is Etay Meiri and I'm a software engineer from Haifa,
Israel.<br>
I've written this series of tutorials (and plan to add more in the
future) to help expand the use of OpenGL. My focus is on using Linux as
a primary development environment, however, most of the code is portable
to other OS's and I provide sources for Windows as well. Any comments, fixes or ports of the code to other OS's will
be greatly appreciated. <br>
